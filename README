Share for Learning Basic C# coding. XML Browsing, Registry saving etc.

I used this program to automatically upload mp3 file via ftp this is also save the settings via windows registry, or settings.bin.

Working and tried with Windows xp, Windows 7 

Once the mp3 is uploaded it will update the XML podcast file, the filename of mp3 uploaded to tsemachadonai need to have a format so this program read the format and will know where to put each item of filename format.

Have fun playing with the code.
